My name is Antoine Brunet - originally from France, but currently working abroad in Montreal in Research and Development, as a system developer. I am interested in all  aspects of IT, but my passion is for IT security.

A major reason that brings me this passion for IT security stems from the diversity of the field. All aspects of IT are involved: network, development, systemsâ€¦ I am constantly learning and being pushed outside of my comfort zone so that I can grow.

I am always working on personal projects in my free time, I like to share, learn, teach, and get constructive critics, in my opinion it is the best way to progess. There reasons brought me to build `My Experiments`. I hope you will enjoy it.
