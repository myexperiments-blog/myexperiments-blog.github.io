My name is Antoine Brunet, currently workin as a penetration tester and product evaluator in a Common Criteria Testing Laboratory (CCTL). I am interested in all aspects of IT, but my passion is IT security.

My passion primarily stems from the diversity of the field. Each aspect of IT are involved: network, development, systemsâ€¦ I am constantly learning and being pushed outside of my comfort zone so that I can grow.

I am always working on personal projects in my free time, I like to share, learn, and teach. These are the reasons that brought me to build this blog, I hope you will enjoy it.
