My name is Antoine Brunet - originally from France, but currently working abroad in Montreal in Research and Development, as a system developer. I am interested in all  aspects of IT, but my passion is for IT security.

The major reason that brings me this passion stems from the diversity of the field. All aspects of IT are involved: network, development, systems… I am constantly learning and being pushed outside of my comfort zone so that I can grow.

I am always working on personal projects in my free time, I like to share, learn, teach, and get constructive critics, in my opinion these are the best way to progress. These are the reasons that brought me to build `My Experiments`. I hope you will enjoy it.
