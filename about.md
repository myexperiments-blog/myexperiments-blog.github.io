My name is Antoine Brunet - originally from France, but currently working abroad in Montreal in Research and Development as a system developer. I am interested in all aspects of IT, but my passion is IT security.

My passion primarily stems from the diversity of the field. Each aspect of IT are involved: network, development, systems… I am constantly learning and being pushed outside of my comfort zone so that I can grow.

I am always working on personal projects in my free time, I like to share, learn, teach, and receive constructive criticism, in my opinion these are the best ways to progress. These are the reasons that brought me to build `My Experiments`. I hope you will enjoy it.
