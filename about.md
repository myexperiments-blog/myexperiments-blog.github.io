My name is Antoine Brunet. I am actually working as a foreigner at Montreal in R&D, in the fields of embedded system development.
I am pretty interested by all the technicals IT fields, but my favorite is the security one.

I am passionate by IT Security for a major reason, the diversity of the field. All aspect of technical IT are involved: network, development, system...
I love the fact that I have always to learn, it keep me in a no comfort zone which is pushing me to always become better. Also, I had work as a pentester in my previous job, I really got so much fun on it. I love the way I have to understand, and master the subject it is just at this moment than you can start to find a way to abuse it.

I am always doing projects in my free time. The most of the time I start, I progress well and I move to an other one before to finish it. Hopefully writing articles in this blog will force me to finish my next projects (It is always good to beleve).
Also, I like to share, teach, and get constructive critics, in my opinion it is the best way to progess. This is these reasons which brought me to build `My Experiments`. I hope you will enjoy it.
